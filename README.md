### ASP.NET Core Challenge 🚀
This repository contains my personal learning projects and exercises using **C# and ASP.NET Core** as part of the Computer Programming and Analysis program at Conestoga College.  

Projects cover **Razor Pages**, **MVC**, **Web API**, and other ASP.NET Core concepts, reflecting class exercises and independent practice.

---

#### 📚 Goals
- Practice **ASP.NET Core fundamentals** (Razor Pages, MVC, Web API)  
- Understand project structure and implement functionality  
- Connect front-end pages with back-end logic and APIs  
- Explore different approaches to the same problem

---

#### 🛠 Languages & Tools
- C#  
- ASP.NET Core  
- Visual Studio Code  

---

#### Projects
- **Blog Project**  
- Full-stack blog with **public viewing** and **authenticated dashboard** for managing posts  
- **Swagger API** demonstrates REST principles (GET, POST, DELETE)  
- Includes **validation, error handling, and unit tests**

- **Clothing Store App**  
> Sample e-commerce web app simulating a clothing store, implementing product listing, shopping cart, and basic user interactions.

- **Laptop Catalogue App (MVC - Extended Project)**  
> Enhanced laptop catalog implemented using MVC patterns, and front-end/back-end integration.
> Added more detailed functionality, controllers, and views
> Used for practical exploration of MVC architecture and advanced features

- **Laptop Catalog (Razor Pages & MVC)**  
> Two versions of the same laptop catalog application: one implemented using **Razor Pages**, the other using **MVC**.
> Both share similar UI and functionality, demonstrating different ASP.NET Core approaches for the same features.

- **Plant API**  
> Web API project for managing plant data, including controllers, and database integration.

- **API Swagger / DTOs Practice**  
> Practice creating APIs with proper documentation using **Swagger** and working with **Data Transfer Objects (DTOs)**.
